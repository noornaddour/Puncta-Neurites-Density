# Puncta-Neurites-Density
Here is all the ImageJ and Matlab scripts that I use for calculating the density of Puncta within neurites.

How to change directory:
using file explorer go into the folder that you wish to be your directory, click on the path in the header of the window (for windows) and copy paste it to the scripts. 

we use:
1.Setting_Scale.ijm
2.Run_Puncta_Analyzer_for_all_images.ijm
3.Puncta_Combined_ROI.ijm
4. you use by hand the semi-automated plugin (Simple Neurite Tracer). Save everythings as SWC, traces file and excel properties sheets.
finally, 
5. Quantifying_puncta_per_neurite.ijm

this is the ordered way to get all imageJ/FIJI quantification.

for MATLAB: 
use the matlab script to divide count over length automatically.
